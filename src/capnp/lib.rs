//! # Cap'n Proto Runtime Library
//!
//! [Cap'n Proto](http://kentonv.github.io/capnproto/) is an extremely efficient protocol for
//! sharing data and capabilities.
//!
//! The Rust implementation is split into three separate crates.
//!
//! Code generation is handled by [capnpc-rust](https://github.com/dwrensha/capnpc-rust).
//!
//! The present crate is the runtime library required by that generated code. It is hosted on Github
//! [here](https://github.com/dwrensha/capnproto-rust).
//!
//! [capnp-rpc-rust](https://github.com/dwrensha/capnp-rpc-rust) is an implementation of a
//! distributed object-capability layer.
